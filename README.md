# Image Viewer

## Problem Description

The **Image Viewer** project is a simple Java application designed to demonstrate file management and project structure using NetBeans. It provides a basic template for handling and visualizing images. The provided files include essential build scripts, configurations, and project metadata to support compilation, execution, and debugging.

This project serves as a foundational starting point for applications requiring image display functionality.

## Functionalities

1. **Build and Execution**:
   - Uses `build.xml` to define customizable targets for building, testing, and running the application.
   - The `manifest.mf` file facilitates JAR file creation and project execution.

2. **Git Integration**:
   - Configured with a Git repository, providing version control metadata.

3. **Extensibility**:
   - Includes pre-configured hooks and scripts (`.git/hooks/`) for tasks like commit validation and code quality checks.

4. **Project Configuration**:
   - Metadata files define NetBeans-specific settings for enhanced IDE integration.
   - Ready-to-edit configurations for adding custom behaviors.
